# CheckTheChart
Check the chart is a utility which helps my league premade judge the state of champion select in League of Legends. This is not a matchup calculator. While disuaders are good against assassins in a broad sense, this does not mean Neeko is a good pick into Fizz on the micro level. In a teamfight, however, Neeko may be good at preventing an assassin from diving in.

## Intro
League of Legends is a MOBA which involves two teams of five players. Each player can pick a character (called *Champions*) out of a pool of more than 154 (and counting). Each champion has their own roles and strengths, meaning the composition of your teams champions is an integral part of strategy, and can ultimately be the deciding factor in whether or not your team wins.

## The champions
Champions generally fall into certain archetypes. These archetypes are not strictly defined and most champions fall into multiple categories. This is just what one member of my team came up with.

- **Engager:** These champions generally are the ones who start the fights, and usually have good crowd control abilities to initiate.
- **Disuader:** These champions are able to peel enemies away from their team and try to prevent engagers and assassins from diving in.
- **Zoner:** These champions are great at keeping space and deny entrance to key areas.
- **Poker:** These champions are able to deal damage from safe distances, winning fights for a team before they even start.
- **Assassin:** These champions are able to dive into the back of enemy ranks and deal tons of damage to key targets.
- **Siege:** These champions are able to destroy objectives efficiently, opening up the map and increasing freedom.
- **Split Push:** These champions create lots of pressure away from the rest of their team, forcing enemies to answer to them, lowering their numbers in a fight.
- **Early Pressure:** The champions are strongest at the beginning of the game, able to create leads early on, which may snowball into a win.

## The site
All champions are sorted into their respective lane. Champions we are good at are marked as a *Good Pick* while champions we don't play as often are marked as a *Poor Pick*. The site then displays which champions counter/get countered by those champions on the macro level.
